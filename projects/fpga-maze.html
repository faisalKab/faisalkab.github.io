    <p>This project involved designing a real-time interactive maze controlled entirely by hand gestures, using IR sensors for input and servo motors for platform tilt. Built on the DE10-Lite FPGA board with Verilog, the system uses PWM to precisely control dual-axis tilt, allowing a steel ball to navigate the maze. A timer starts and stops based on IR sensor detection at the mazeâ€™s start/end points, and high scores are recorded on the 7-segment HEX display. The final design features full touchless gameplay, wave-motion input, and a scoring system.</p>
